# Project Statement – Notebook Application (Notes Saver)

## 1. Problem Statement
Students and general users often need a simple way to store small notes such as reminders, study points, tasks, or ideas.  
Most note-taking apps are either too heavy or require internet access.  
A very lightweight, simple, text-based system is needed that can save and manage notes easily on any computer.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:
- A basic text-based notebook system.
- Allowing the user to create, view, search, edit, and delete notes.
- Storing all notes inside a simple text file using Python file handling.
- Providing a clean menu interface for easy navigation.
- Implementing modular programming with multiple Python files.

The project does **not** include advanced GUI, encryption, cloud sync, or multi-user login, as it is intended for first-semester learning.

## 3. Target Users
This Notebook Application is mainly useful for:
- Students who want to save study notes or reminders.
- Beginners learning programming and file handling.
- Anyone who needs a fast and simple offline note storage tool.
- Users who prefer a lightweight alternative to large note-taking apps.

## 4. High-Level Features
- Add new notes and store them permanently in a text file.
- View all saved notes in a numbered list.
- Search notes by keyword.
- Edit any existing note by selecting its number.
- Delete notes from the list.
- Modular Python design (6 separate modules).
- Simple, easy-to-use menu-driven interface.
