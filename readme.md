# Notebook Application (Notes Saver)

This is a simple Python-based Notebook Application made as part of my B.Tech 1st semester project.  
The project allows a user to save, view, search, edit, and delete notes.  
It mainly uses basic Python concepts and file handling.

## Features
1. Add note  
2. View all notes  
3. Search a note  
4. Edit a note  
5. Delete a note  

## How It Works
- The program stores all notes inside **notes.txt**.
- User interacts through a text menu.
- Each option performs a different operation.
